# Hi, I'm Maciek 👋

I'm 18 years old front-end developer from Poland 🇵🇱.

I really enjoy creating apps, which can make life easier, particularly chess related apps as I'm a chess enthusiast 😎♟️.

Apart from chess and coding, I workout at the gym and read self-improvement books 📖.

I participated twice in a Erasmus+ project, which improved my English skills and confidence in speaking in foreign language 💪.

I learn the most by creating projects and by studing other people's code ⌨.

## Technologies I use:
- React and Next 13
- Tailwind
- Typescript 
- React Query
- Prisma
- MySQL
- SvelteKit
- Vercel
- TRPC (beginner level)
- Express.js - REST APIs (beginner level)
- Git (beginner level)

## My projects (made all by myself):

### [📝 Rapid Notes](https://github.com/macias34/notes)
An app for practicing English vocabulary. You create notes and then repeat them using a test.

### [📷 Instagram Clone](https://github.com/macias34/instagram-clone)
A cloned Instagram application. In the app, we can manage posts, follow users, and react to their posts.

### [♟️Chess blog](https://github.com/macias34/blog)
An application for creating a blog. On the blog, we can display posts, manage them, and add categories to them.

### [♟️Lichess analyzer](https://github.com/macias34/lichess_analyzer)
An application for analyzing a user's profile on lichess.org. It displays the user's ranking progress and their highest ranking.

### [🛠️ Workers management system](https://github.com/macias34/workers)
The application allows for managing employees, their employment status, and the team they work in.

## Technologies I'm learning now 🤓:
- whole T3 Stack (I really enjoy DX of this stack 😄): 
  - React and Next (still improving)
  - Tailwind (still improving)
  - Prisma (still improving)
  - NextAuth (used it once in [📷 Instagram Clone](https://github.com/macias34/instagram-clone))
  - TRPC (used it once in[📷 Instagram Clone](https://github.com/macias34/instagram-clone))
- Typescript (I know the basics and some intermediate stuff)
